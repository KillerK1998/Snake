# Overview

In this project I decided to make a game framework using C++

The game that I decided to do was a simple snake game since I used this to learn how to make a game framework. And I figured what better way to show off what I learned than by making a simple snake game.

The purpose of this project was to test my knowledge on what I know on C++, I figured that since I will be making games using C++ in the future I figured that this would be the perfect way to show off my skills.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
